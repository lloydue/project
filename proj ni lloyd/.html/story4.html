<h3>Story:</h3>
    <p>The Little Red Hen found wheat and asked for help planting it. The cat, dog, and duck refused.</p>
    <p>She harvested, ground the wheat, and baked the bread—all alone. When the bread was ready, the animals wanted some, but she said, "Since you didn’t help, you won’t eat."</p>
    <p>Moral: Those who do the work deserve the reward.</p>
