<h3>Story:</h3>
    <p>A little duckling was born different. He was teased for being ugly and left alone. After struggling through a harsh winter, he found a group of swans.</p>
    <p>Looking at his reflection, he realized he had grown into a beautiful swan. He was never ugly—he was just different.</p>
    <p>Moral: True beauty comes from within, and differences make us special.</p>
